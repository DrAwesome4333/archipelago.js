# Report Errors or Improvements to these Guides

These guides are created with the sole purpose of helping new or existing developers create Archipelago JavaScript 
clients quickly and easily, but sometimes mistakes happen.

If you notice an issue with any of these guides, or want to request new content to help improve the existing 
documentation, please create an issue on [this project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/ThePhar/archipelago.js). 
Be sure it's titled appropriately and include as much information as possible inside the issue description.

Also, if you prefer to make the improvements yourself, you can fork the repository and submit a pull request as well!
