# Introduction to archipelago.js

I'll assume if you're reading this, you're probably looking to develop a JavaScript client for Archipelago. Well 
congratulations, you've come to the right place. These guides will teach you things such as:

* How to set up your developer environment for **archipelago.js**.
* How to create a basic chat-based client.
* How to create a more advanced client that can mark locations as "checked" and listens for received item events.
* An in-depth explanation and examples for commonly performed actions (e.g., data package caching, message parsing, data
  storage manipulation).
* Additional features supported by **archipelago.js**.
* Common errors and "gotchas" to be expected.
* And much more.

## Before we begin...

The **archipelago.js** library is developed for a JavaScript (or TypeScript) based client to run in the browser or via 
a server-side runtime such as [Node](https://nodejs.org) or [Bun](https://bun.sh). This will require ***you*** to have
a decent grasp of JavaScript itself, including concepts such as (but not limited to):

* How classes, objects, functions, etc. works.
* How Promises and `async`/`await` works.
* How ECMAScript modules (`import`/`export`) work.
* How `this` binding works.

You *can* probably get along without being familiar with these concepts, but your developer experience will be more
challenging. Don't say I didn't warn you, at least.
